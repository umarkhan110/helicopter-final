# Mapbox Template

## The general process of making a map
- Geocoding if needed
- importing data into MapboxGL.js
- Making your layers pretty, use mapbox studio map maker to make styles you can import
- Filter boxes
- SEO, like thumbnail and text title

## What i've done wrong before and could be improved on
- Putting everything into modules so it's not all messy
